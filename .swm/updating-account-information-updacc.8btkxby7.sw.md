title: Updating Account Information (UPDACC)
---
The UPDACC program is responsible for updating account information in the database. It is initiated by the BNK1UAC program and follows a specific flow to ensure the account details are correctly updated. The process starts with identifying the account using the SORTCODE, updating the necessary fields, and then ending the program.

The flow starts with the BNK1UAC program calling the UPDACC program. The UPDACC program begins by identifying the account to be updated using the SORTCODE. It then updates the account information in the database, ensuring all fields are valid. Finally, the program ends and returns control to the calling program.

# Where is this program used?

This program is used once, in a flow starting from `BNK1UAC` as represented in the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
BNK1UAC("BNK1UAC") --> UPDACC("UPDACC program"):::currentProgram

  classDef currentProgram color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
```

Lets' zoom into the flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
  premiere["PREMIERE<br>Program Start"]:::a0d8d6d1e --> update-account-db2["UPDATE-ACCOUNT-DB2<br>Update Account Information"]
  update-account-db2 --> get-me-out-of-here["GET-ME-OUT-OF-HERE<br>End Program"]
  classDef a0d8d6d1e color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
```

## PREMIERE Section

The <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/UPDACC.cbl" pos="158:1:1" line-data="       PREMIERE SECTION.">`PREMIERE`</SwmToken> section is responsible for initiating the process of updating account information. It starts by moving the <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/UPDACC.cbl" pos="161:3:3" line-data="           MOVE SORTCODE TO COMM-SCODE.">`SORTCODE`</SwmToken> to <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/UPDACC.cbl" pos="161:7:9" line-data="           MOVE SORTCODE TO COMM-SCODE.">`COMM-SCODE`</SwmToken> and <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/UPDACC.cbl" pos="162:7:11" line-data="           MOVE SORTCODE TO DESIRED-SORT-CODE.">`DESIRED-SORT-CODE`</SwmToken>, which are used for identifying the account to be updated. Then, it performs the <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/UPDACC.cbl" pos="167:3:7" line-data="           PERFORM UPDATE-ACCOUNT-DB2">`UPDATE-ACCOUNT-DB2`</SwmToken> section to update the account information in the database. Finally, it performs the <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/UPDACC.cbl" pos="174:3:11" line-data="           PERFORM GET-ME-OUT-OF-HERE.">`GET-ME-OUT-OF-HERE`</SwmToken> section to end the program.

```cobol
       PREMIERE SECTION.
       A010.

           MOVE SORTCODE TO COMM-SCODE.
           MOVE SORTCODE TO DESIRED-SORT-CODE.

      *
      *           Update the account information
      *
           PERFORM UPDATE-ACCOUNT-DB2

      *
      *    The COMMAREA values have now been set so all we need to do
      *    is finish
      *

           PERFORM GET-ME-OUT-OF-HERE.

       A999.
           EXIT.

It starts by positioning itself at the matching account record using the <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/UPDACC.cbl" pos="188:15:15" line-data="           MOVE DESIRED-SORT-CODE TO HV-ACCOUNT-SORTCODE.">`SORTCODE`</SwmToken> and <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/UPDACC.cbl" pos="195:1:1" line-data="                     ACCOUNT_NUMBER,">`ACCOUNT_NUMBER`</SwmToken>. It then checks if the read was successful. If not, it marks the return field as not successful and exits. If the read was successful, it updates the account record with the new information provided. It also ensures that the account type, interest rate, and overdraft limit are valid before updating. Finally, it sets the success code if the update was successful.

```cobol

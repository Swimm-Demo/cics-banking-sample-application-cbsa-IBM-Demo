title: Deleting Customer (DELCUS)
---
The DELCUS program is responsible for deleting a customer record from the system. This process involves initializing the deletion, verifying the customer's existence, retrieving and deleting associated accounts, and finally removing the customer record from the VSAM file. The program ensures that all related data is properly handled before completing the deletion process.

The flow starts by setting up the necessary information to identify the customer. It then verifies if the customer exists, retrieves any associated accounts, deletes those accounts, and finally removes the customer record from the system. Each step ensures that the data is correctly processed and the deletion is successful.

# Where is this program used?

This program is used once, in a flow starting from `BNK1DCS` as represented in the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
BNK1DCS("BNK1DCS") --> DELCUS("DELCUS program"):::currentProgram

  classDef currentProgram color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
```

Lets' zoom into the flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
  premiere["PREMIERE<br>Program Start"]:::a0d8d6d1e --> id-0["INQCUST<br>Call to INQCUST"]
  id-0 -..-> get-accounts["GET-ACCOUNTS<br>Retrieve Customer Accounts"]
  get-accounts -..-> del-cust-vsam["DEL-CUST-VSAM<br>Delete Customer Record"]
  del-cust-vsam --> get-me-out-of-here["GET-ME-OUT-OF-HERE<br>End Process"]
  classDef a0d8d6d1e color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
```

## Initializing Customer Deletion

First, the <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/DELCUS.cbl" pos="246:1:1" line-data="       PREMIERE SECTION.">`PREMIERE`</SwmToken> section initializes the customer deletion process by setting up the required sort code and customer number. This is essential for identifying the customer record to be deleted.

```cobol
       PREMIERE SECTION.
       A010.

           MOVE SORTCODE TO REQUIRED-SORT-CODE
                            REQUIRED-SORT-CODE OF CUSTOMER-KY
                            DESIRED-KEY-SORTCODE.

           MOVE COMM-CUSTNO OF DFHCOMMAREA
             TO DESIRED-KEY-CUSTOMER.

```

## Calling INQCUST Program

Next, the program calls <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/DELCUS.cbl" pos="256:3:3" line-data="           INITIALIZE INQCUST-COMMAREA.">`INQCUST`</SwmToken> to verify the existence of the customer. This step ensures that the customer record is valid and can be processed for deletion.

```cobol
           INITIALIZE INQCUST-COMMAREA.
           MOVE COMM-CUSTNO OF DFHCOMMAREA TO
              INQCUST-CUSTNO.

           EXEC CICS LINK PROGRAM(INQCUST-PROGRAM)
                     COMMAREA(INQCUST-COMMAREA)
           END-EXEC.
```

## Handling INQCUST Response

Then, the program checks the response from <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/DELCUS.cbl" pos="264:3:3" line-data="           IF INQCUST-INQ-SUCCESS = &#39;N&#39;">`INQCUST`</SwmToken>. If the inquiry is unsuccessful, it sets the deletion success flag to 'N' and returns, terminating the process.

```cobol

           IF INQCUST-INQ-SUCCESS = 'N'
             MOVE 'N' TO COMM-DEL-SUCCESS
             MOVE INQCUST-INQ-FAIL-CD TO COMM-DEL-FAIL-CD
             EXEC CICS RETURN
             END-EXEC
           END-IF.
```

## Retrieving Customer Accounts

Moving to the next step, the program performs <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/DELCUS.cbl" pos="271:3:5" line-data="           PERFORM GET-ACCOUNTS">`GET-ACCOUNTS`</SwmToken> to retrieve any accounts associated with the customer. If accounts are found, it proceeds to delete them.

```cobol
           PERFORM GET-ACCOUNTS
      *
      *          If there are related accounts found then delete
      *          them.
      *
           IF NUMBER-OF-ACCOUNTS > 0
             PERFORM DELETE-ACCOUNTS
           END-IF
```

The <SwmToken path="/src/base/cobol_src/DELCUS.cbl" pos="322:1:3" line-data="       GET-ACCOUNTS SECTION.">`GET-ACCOUNTS`</SwmToken> section calls the <SwmToken path="/src/base/cobol_src/DELCUS.cbl" pos="334:10:10" line-data="           EXEC CICS LINK PROGRAM(&#39;INQACCCU&#39;)">`INQACCCU`</SwmToken>program to get all the accounts of the given customer.

## Deleting Customer Record

After deleting the accounts, the program performs <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/DELCUS.cbl" pos="286:3:7" line-data="           PERFORM DEL-CUST-VSAM">`DEL-CUST-VSAM`</SwmToken> to delete the customer record from the VSAM file. This step ensures that the customer data is completely removed from the system.

```cobol
      *
      *    Having deleted the accounts and written the
      *    details to the PROCTRAN datastore, if we haven't abended
      *    then we must go on to delete the CUSTOMER record
      *

           PERFORM DEL-CUST-VSAM

```

## Finalizing Deletion Process

Finally, the program sets the deletion success flag to 'Y' and clears any failure codes. It then performs <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/DELCUS.cbl" pos="292:3:11" line-data="           PERFORM GET-ME-OUT-OF-HERE.">`GET-ME-OUT-OF-HERE`</SwmToken> to end the process and return control.

```cobol
           MOVE 'Y' TO COMM-DEL-SUCCESS.
           MOVE ' ' TO COMM-DEL-FAIL-CD.

           PERFORM GET-ME-OUT-OF-HERE.

       A999.
           EXIT.
```

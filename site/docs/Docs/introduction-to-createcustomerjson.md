# Introduction to CreateCustomerJson

## Introduction to CreateCustomerJson

The `CreateCustomerJson` class represents the JSON structure for creating a customer. It is designed to facilitate the conversion of customer details into a JSON format for further processing.

## Structure of CreateCustomerJson

The class contains a field `creCust`, which is an instance of `CrecustJson`. This field is annotated with `@JsonProperty` to map the JSON property `CRECUST`. The class has two constructors: a default constructor and another that takes a <SwmToken path="src/Z-OS-Connect-Customer-Services-Interface/src/main/java/com/ibm/cics/cip/bank/springboot/customerservices/jsonclasses/createcustomer/CreateCustomerForm.java" pos="9:4:4" line-data="public class CreateCustomerForm">`CreateCustomerForm`</SwmToken> object to initialize the `creCust` field.

{


	@NotNull
	@Size(max = 61)
	private String custName;

	@NotNull
	@Size(max = 161)
	private String custAddress;

	@NotNull
	@Size(min = 8, max = 8)
	private String custDob;


	public CreateCustomerForm()
	{
		super();
	}
```
